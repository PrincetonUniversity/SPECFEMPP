## About


SPECFEM kokkos is C++ implementation of SPECFEM suite of software using the [Kokkos](<https://kokkos.github.io/>) programming model. Kokkos is a is a production level solution for writing modern C++ applications in a hardware agnostic way, this allows us to write a single source code which can run across all modern architectures. The goal of this project is to provide the same level of functionality as provided by SPECFEM2D, SPECFEM3D and SPECFEM3d_GLOBE in a singular package that runs across all architectures.
