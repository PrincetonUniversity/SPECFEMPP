## About

SPECFEM++ is a complete re-write of SPECFEM suite of packages (SPECFEM2D, SPECFEM3D, SPECFEM3D_GLOBE) using C++. Compared to the earlier version, SPECFEM++ code base provides:

 1. a robust and flexible code structure,
 2. modularity that allows for easy addition of new features,
 3. portability that allows the code to run on a variety of architectures (CPU, NVIDIA GPUs, Intel GPUs, AMD GPUs etc.), and
 4. a user-friendly build infrastructure that allows the code to be easily compiled and run on a variety of platforms.
