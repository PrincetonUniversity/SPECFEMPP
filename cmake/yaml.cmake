# is not guaranteed for ADIOS2, which internally wants to/can build yaml. But
# the internal yaml version is not accessible to our build. The solution is to
# configure yaml-cpp to be built as part of the SPECFEM++ build. with the same
# version that ADIOS2 expects, and create a fictitious config file for it.
# There are still compiler warnings from yaml, but they can be ignored for now.
# If we build without ADIOS2 support we just simply use the newer version. To
# Avoid the warnings alltogether.
