.. admonition:: Community Project

    SPECFEM++ is a community project. We welcome contributions from everyone. Please see contribution section for more details.

.. admonition:: Under Development

    The package is currently under development and is not yet ready for production use. We are working towards making the package more complete. Please `report any bugs <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/specfem2d_kokkos/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=>`_ you find or `request features <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/specfem2d_kokkos/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=>`_ that you would like to see in the package.

.. admonition:: Monthly Developer Meetings

    We host a monthly developer meeting on the first Wednesday of every month at 12:00 PM Eastern Time. Please join us if you are interested in contributing to the project or would like to learn more about the project. Please see `this page <https://github.com/orgs/SPECFEM/discussions>`_ for more details.

SPECFEM++ is a complete re-write of SPECFEM suite of packages (SPECFEM2D, SPECFEM3D, SPECFEM3D_GLOBE) using C++. Compared to the earlier version, SPECFEM++ code base provides:

 1. a robust and flexible code structure,
 2. modularity that allows for easy addition of new features,
 3. portability that allows the code to run on a variety of architectures (CPU, NVIDIA GPUs, Intel GPUs, AMD GPUs etc.), and
 4. a user-friendly build infrastructure that allows the code to be easily compiled and run on a variety of platforms.

.. admonition:: Download the code

    The code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/specfem2d_kokkos/tree/main>`_.

\* Not tested. This, in general means that the feature is not tested in
continuous integration if the entire column has a star, and if the row has a
star, it means that the feature is not tested/does not match the `Fortran`
version of `specfem2d`. In the former case, see `HIP` column, and for the latter
case, see the Poroelastic Isotropic row.

\*\* Not peer reviewed yet.

.. note::

    While we work towards building this package and making the
    code/documentation more complete, please refer relevant SPECFEM package
    documentations for technical details on SPECFEM theory.
