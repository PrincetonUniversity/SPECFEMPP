Developer documentation
============================

At SPECFEM we try to follow best practices to keep the code readable, maintainable and reproducable. This section outlines several best practices we follow in the development process. If you contribute to this project we expect you to follow these practices.

Git development workflow
=========================

At SPECFEM we follow master-develop workflow. The master (main) branch is always a stable working code and is generally synced with the latest release of SPECFEM. The develop branch is a stable code with potentially new features which haven't been released inside of SPECFEM yet.
