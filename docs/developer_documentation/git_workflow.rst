Git development workflow
=========================

At SPECFEM++ we follow master-develop workflow. The master (main) branch is always a stable working code and is generally synced with the latest release of SPECFEM++. The develop branch is a stable code with potentially new features which haven't been released in the latest version of SPECFEM++ yet. If you are contributing to SPECFEM++ then issue your `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_ against the develop branch.

To make a change to SPECFEM++ (This development workflow is similar to the one suggested by `github <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request>`_)

- Create a `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#fork>`_ of the SPECFEM++ repository. This will be your version of the package where you'd make changes which will stay local to your version until you make a pull request against original repository.

- Clone your fork locally and checkout to develop
.. code-block:: bash

    git clone <git link to your fork>
    git checkout develop

.. note::

    It is also recommended that you run :code:`poetry install` every time you pull the develop branch. Please check :ref:`style section<style>` for more information on poetry.

.. note::

    Please also install pre-commit hooks after you've cloned repo. :code:`poetry run pre-commit install`

- Next create a feature branch against develop branch called a feature branch. Please be explicit while naming the feature branch.

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b <name-of-the-feature-brach>

- Make your contributions inside the feature branch and then commit push them upstream.

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin <name-of-the-feature-brach>

- Finally, head over to the main `SPECFEM++ repo <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/specfempp>`_ and issue a pull request against the develop branch. Once you've issued a pull request one of the maintainers will have a look at the changes, before approving a merge.
