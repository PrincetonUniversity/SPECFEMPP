Chapter 6: SPECFEM++ iteration policies
========================================

In :ref:`Chapter5`, we discussed data-types in SPECFEM++ that essentially depend on the heirarchy of the mesh. In this chapter, we will introduce the iteration policies within SPECFEM++ that enable us to iterate over the mesh heirarchy in a consistent manner.

There are three iteration policies in SPECFEM++:

1. :ref:`Range Policy <RangePolicy>`
2. :ref:`Chunk Element Policy <ChunkElementPolicy>`
3. :ref:`Edge Policy <policy_edge_index>`
