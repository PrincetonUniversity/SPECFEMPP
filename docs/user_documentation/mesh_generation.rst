Mesh Generation
===============

In this version of the package meshfem has not been implemented. However, the package can read internal meshes generated via `SPECFEM2D mesh generator <https://specfem2d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03_mesh_generation/>`_ . Please refer to the documentation there to generate meshes. Thus for now, we require a *Par_file* for generation of mesh and a *configuration file* for setting up and running the solver.
