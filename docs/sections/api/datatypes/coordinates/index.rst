Point Coordinates
=================

Point coordinates are used to store the coordinates of a point within the mesh.
The coordinates have three components:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    local_coordinates
    global_coordinates

The associated indeces are stored in the :cpp:class:`specfem::point::index`
struct.
