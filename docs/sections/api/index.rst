API documentation
=================

The documentation is under development while we are restructuring the codebase.
Parts the are being moved to the new structure are directly below this line.

.. note:: For reference, we are keeping a pinned issue on GitHub describing the
          restructuring process and the reasoning behind it.
          See :issue:`190` for more details.
