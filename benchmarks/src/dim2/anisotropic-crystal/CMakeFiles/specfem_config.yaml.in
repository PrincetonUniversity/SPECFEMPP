## Coupling interfaces have code flow that is dependent on orientation of the interface.
## This test is to check the code flow for horizontal acoustic-elastic interface with acoustic domain on top.

    description: |
      Material systems : Elastic domain (1), Acoustic domain (1)
      Interfaces : Acoustic-elastic interface (1) (orientation horizontal with acoustic domain on top)
      Sources : Force source (1)
      Boundary conditions : Neumann BCs on all edges
      Debugging comments: This tests checks coupling acoustic-elastic interface implementation.
                          The orientation of the interface is horizontal with acoustic domain on top.
