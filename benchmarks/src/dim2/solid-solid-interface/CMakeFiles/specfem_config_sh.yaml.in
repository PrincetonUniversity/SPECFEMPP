## Coupling interfaces have code flow that is dependent on orientation of the interface.
## This test is to check the code flow for horizontal elastic-elastic interface.

    description: |
      Material systems : Elastic domain (1), Elastic domain (1)
      Interfaces : Elastic-elastic interface (1) (orientation horizontal slower medium on top)
      Sources : Force source (1)
      Boundary conditions : Neumann BCs on all edges
      Debugging comments: This tests checks coupling elastic-elastic interface implementation.
                          The orientation of the interface is horizontal with elastic domain on top.
