  header:
    ## Header information is used for logging. It is good practice to give your simulations explicit names
    title: Heterogeneous acoustic-elastic medium with 1 acoustic-elastic interface # name for your simulation
    # A detailed description for your simulation
    description: |
      Material systems : Elastic domain (1), Acoustic domain (1)
      Interfaces : Acoustic-elastic interface (1)
      Sources : Force source (1)
      Boundary conditions : Neumann BCs on all edges

  simulation-setup:
    ## quadrature setup
    quadrature:
      quadrature-type: GLL4 # fourth order Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature (5 GLL points)

    ## Solver setup
    solver:
      time-marching:
        type-of-simulation: forward # forward simulation (adjoint simulation is not supported yet)
        time-scheme:
          type: Newmark # Newmark time integration scheme
          dt: 0.85e-3 # (seconds)
          nstep: 800 # number of time steps

  receivers:
    stations-file: "@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/examples/fluid_solid_interface/OUTPUT_FILES/STATIONS"
    angle: 0.0 # angle of the receiver line (degrees)
    seismogram-type:
      - displacement
      - velocity
    nstep_between_samples: 1 # number of time steps between seismogram samples (sampling rate = dt * nstep_between_samples)
                             # seismograms are only written to disk at the end of the simulation

  ## Runtime setup
  run-setup:
    # only single MPI processor is supported at the moment
    number-of-processors: 1 # number of MPI processors
    number-of-runs: 1 # number of concurrent runs (only single run is supported at the moment)

  ## databases
  databases:
    # Database files are generated by the meshing tool (xmeshfem2D)
    mesh-database: "@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/examples/fluid-solid-interface/OUTPUT_FILES/database.bin"
    # YAML file describing the sources See examples/fluid-solid-interface/sources.yaml for details
    source-file: "@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/examples/fluid-solid-interface/sources.yaml"

  seismogram:
