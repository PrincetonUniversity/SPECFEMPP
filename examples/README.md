# Examples

This directory contains a couple of minimal examples of how to use the
`specfem++` package. The examples are designed to be simple and easy to
they demonstrate the basic usage of the package. They are not intended to be
comprehensive or exhaustive. For more detailed examples, please refer to the
[cookbooks in the documentation](https://specfem2d-kokkos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/index.html).

The examples are organized into subdirectories, each containing a single example.

The examples are as follows:
* 2D Examples (`dim2/`):
  - `homogeneous-elastic`: A simple example that demonstrates how to use the
    package to solves wave propagation in a homogeneous elastic medium with
    flat topography.
  - `fluid-solid`: An example that demonstrates how to use the package to solve
    wave propagation with fluid-solid coupling.
  - `poroelastic-semi-infinite` An example that simulates wave propagation
    through a 2-dimensional poroelastic medium.
