Dear all,

That was a very impressive meshing!

Out of curiosity, I modified the GMSH .geo file and tried to mesh in
the Cubit/Trelis. Cubit script and mesh picture are attached. I think
mesh quality is generally better, but still there are few low-quality
elements. The mesh has the average 9.652e-01 and minimum 1.083e-02
scaled jacobian ( higher the better 1.00 being the maximum). I found
at least 35 out 435 surfaces that have to be tweaked or collapsed if
we need a higher quality mesh.

Thanks,
Hom Nath.
